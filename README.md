ðŸš€ LeetCode - Day 2: Two Sum (Python)

This repository contains my **Day 2** solution for the [LeetCode #1 - Two Sum]

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

> Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to `target`.
>  
> You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

---

## âœ… Example

```python
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]  
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
