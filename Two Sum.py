We iterate over the list only once, and each lookup/insertion in the hash map (dict) is O(1) on average.

So if n is the number of elements in nums, the whole algorithm runs in linear time.

We're using extra space for the seen dictionary.

In the worst case (where no two numbers add up to the target until the end), the dictionary stores all n numbers,
 making the space complexity O(n)."""
